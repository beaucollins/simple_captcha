SimpleCaptcha is a plugin for rubyonrails applications to provide the captcha functionality.
The important thing for is its sipmplicity in usage and a variety of images styles.
Currently it provides eight different image styles that can be implemented quite easily.
For more details see the plugin's documentation on http://expressica.com .


Pre-requisites
==============
1.) RMagick
RMagick is the image handling library in ruby and is required to implement the SimpleCaptcha.
RMagick is available on RubyForge http://rubyforge.org


Installation
============
SimpleCaptcha plugin can be installed by running this command from the application root
>> ruby script\plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/expressica/plugins/simple_captcha


Usage
======

Controller Based 
-----------------

In the view file within the form tags write this code

<%= show_simple_captcha %>

and in the controller' action authenticate it as 

if simple_captcha_valid?
 do this
else
 do that
end


Model Based
------------

In the view file within the form tags write this code

<%= show_simple_captcha(:object=>"user") %>

and in the model class add this code

class User < ActiveRecord::Basse
  apply_simple_captcha
end

We may need to save the instance where captcha is not at all needed, actually captcha is usually needed
on some particular screen only eg. signing up of a new user.
So, here is the detail of explicit methods to authenticate and validate the instance with captch.


-- for validating 

use @user.valid_with_captcha? when captcha authentication is required
and use @user.valid? when captcha authentication is not required.


-- for saving

use @user.save_with_captcha when captcha authentication is required
and use @user.save when captcha authentication is not required.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The view helper method show_simple_captcha can accept the following options
1.) :label
	provide the custom text b/w the image and the text field, 
	the default is "type the text from the image"
2.) :image_style
	we can provide the specific image style out of the eight styles available,
	the default is "simply_blue"
3.) :object
	the name of the object of the model class, to implement the model based captcha.

example --  <%= show_simple_captcha(:image_style => "embosed_silver", :label => "human authentication") %>
